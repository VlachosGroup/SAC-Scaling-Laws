# Introduction to kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) Simulations with Examples in Jupyter Notebooks
The notebooks contain the basic concepts of kinetic Monte Carlo simluations and its applications in both well-mixed and lattice systems taken from the literature.

For lattice kMC, the software named [zacros](http://zacros.org/) is used. Its Python Wrapper can be downloaded or cloned from [Zacros-Wrapper GitHub repository](https://github.com/VlachosGroup/Zacros-Wrapper).
