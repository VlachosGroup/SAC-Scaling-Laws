# Training Scaling Relationships for Single-atom Catalysts
The notebooks contain the workflow of training scaling relationships based on physical descriptors (features) using various machine learning methods.


## Developers
- Yifan Wang (wangyf@udel.edu)

## Scaling Relationships are developed for 
- $E_{bind}$, the binding energy of single-metal atom on a support
- $E_a$, the activation barrier for metal atom diffusion 

## Machine Learning Methods Used:
- LASSO regression
- Ridge regression
- Elastic net
- Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression
- Genetic Programming based on sybomlic regression
